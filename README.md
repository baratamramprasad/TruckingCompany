# TruckingCompany problem
# Problem Statement
A trucking company deals with a lot of invoices close to 40,000 a day. Regulatory requirements need 7 years of data to be stored.
A trucker scans the invoice on his mobile device at the point of delivery. Image recognition program scans the invoice and adds
meta information captured from the image. Meta information will include shipped from and shipped to and other information.
The trucking company can see all its invoices, the shipped from organizations can view all invoices whose shipped from matches with theirs,
similar rules apply to shipped to.

## Questions:
   * How would you design a system to store all this data in a cost efficient way.
   * How would you design a authorization system to ensure organizations can only see invoices based on rules stated above.
   * What would be the design considerations to make the solution globally available ?
